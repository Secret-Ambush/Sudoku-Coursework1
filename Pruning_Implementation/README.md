## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from pruning_demo import PruningSudokuSolver, solve_sudoku_pruning

# Define a puzzle (empty cells as empty strings or '0')
puzzle = [
    ["5", "3", "", "", "7", "", "", "", ""],
    ["6", "", "", "1", "9", "5", "", "", ""],
    ["", "9", "8", "", "", "", "", "6", ""],
    ["8", "", "", "", "6", "", "", "", "3"],
    ["4", "", "", "8", "", "3", "", "", "1"],
    ["7", "", "", "", "2", "", "", "", "6"],
    ["", "6", "", "", "", "", "2", "8", ""],
    ["", "", "", "4", "1", "9", "", "", "5"],
    ["", "", "", "", "8", "", "", "7", "9"]
]

# Method 1: Using the class
solver = PruningSudokuSolver(puzzle)
success, solution, stats = solver.solve()

if success:
    solver.print_grid(solution, "Solution")
    print(f"Solved in {stats['time']:.4f} seconds!")
else:
    print("No solution found!")

# Method 2: Using convenience function
success, solution, stats = solve_sudoku_pruning(puzzle)
```

### Running Examples

```bash
# Run comprehensive demonstration
python pruning_demo.py

# Run simple usage examples
python example_usage.py

# Run original pygame version
python app1.py
```

## Algorithm Details

### **Core Algorithm**

The solver uses a straightforward backtracking approach:

1. **Find Empty Cell**: Efficiently locate the next empty cell
2. **Try Values**: Attempt values 1-9 for the empty cell
3. **Validate**: Check if the value violates Sudoku constraints
4. **Recurse**: If valid, recursively solve the rest of the puzzle
5. **Backtrack**: If no valid values work, backtrack to previous cell

### **Optimization Techniques**

1. **Efficient Cell Finding**: Single-pass search for empty cells
2. **Optimized Validation**: Uses Python's `in` operator for O(1) lookups
3. **Minimal Overhead**: No constraint propagation or complex heuristics
4. **Direct Board Access**: Direct manipulation of integer board representation

### **Constraint Checking**

```python
def is_valid_optimized(board, row, col, num):
    # Check row
    if num in board[row]:
        return False
    
    # Check column  
    if num in [board[i][col] for i in range(9)]:
        return False
    
    # Check 3x3 box
    box_row, box_col = 3 * (row // 3), 3 * (col // 3)
    for i in range(box_row, box_row + 3):
        for j in range(box_col, box_col + 3):
            if board[i][j] == num:
                return False
    
    return True
```

## Input/Output Format

### Input Format
Puzzles should be provided as 9×9 grids where:
- Given cells contain digits "1" through "9"
- Empty cells are represented as empty strings `""` or `"0"`
- Each row should have exactly 9 elements

### Output Format
The solver returns:
- **Success**: Boolean indicating if a solution was found

- **Statistics**: Dictionary containing:
  - `time`: Solving time in seconds
  - `assignments`: Number of variable assignments made

## Performance Tips

1. **Use integer representation**: Convert string grids to integers for faster processing
2. **Minimize function calls**: Inline simple operations when possible
3. **Efficient data structures**: Use Python's built-in optimizations (`in` operator)
4. **Profile your code**: Use `time.time()` for accurate performance measurement

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- **Constraint propagation**: Add forward checking
